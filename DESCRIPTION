Description: A communications simulation package supporting common wireless modulation
    formats including BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The package includes AWGN
    noise generation, and raised cosine and square root raised cosine pulse shaping. It also
    includes convenience functions for plotting constellation diagrams, density plots, stem
    plots and eye diagrams. Together these functions enable the evaluation of bit error and
    symbol error rates, evaluation of pulse shaping and inter-symbol interference and support
    visualization of the respective signals and noise in a variety of formats.
