Description: A basic wireless communications simulation package in R. The package includes
    modulation functions for BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. Also included is
    an AWGN noise generation function. Additionally, the package includes functions to plot
    an I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) scatter diagram, or density plot. Together these functions
    enable the evaluation of respective bit error and symbol rates in an AWGN channel and for
    easily viewing the respective signals and noise in a scatter plot or density plot.
